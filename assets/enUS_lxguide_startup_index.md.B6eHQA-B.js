This is exactly what the Configuration Assistant automates.</p><p>But for now, whether it is Windows, macOS or a Linux distribution with a desktop environment, or whether the architecture is x86-64, x86-S, amd64 or ARM64, you have downloaded the corresponding LauncherX according to the current operating system to your desired location. The folder in which it is run, and <a target="_blank" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/dotnet/7.0">has prepared the runtime environment accordingly</a> (the configuration assistant will be completed automatically, and this step is not required when including the run), then you can double-click its icon to run it like other apps.</p><p>Next, I will list all known possible issues.</p><h2 id="common-issues" tabindex="-1">Common issues <a class="header-anchor" href="#common-issues" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Common issues&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Since our Java RE detection mechanism works in &quot;search-execution&quot; mode to confirm whether the runtime is available, you may encounter an error pop-up window from Java when you start LauncherX. You can turn it off directly, as this will not affect LauncherX runs. You can <strong>remove</strong> the damaged runtime.</p>',13)]))}const p=t(i,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,p as default};
