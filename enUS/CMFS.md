## component

* CMFS-Pure: Pure survival server! You can join the game through a specific version of Minecraft and experience the unique gameplay carefully conceived by us. *AH... This server is under maintenance*

* CMFS-SquareCraft: SquareCraft Server is a Mod server that we cooperate with SquareCraft. Enjoy the "living soul" of Minecraft in our high-performance, stable servers: highly free and highly scalable. *This server is in a hypothetical state*

* CMFS-Eksamen You are free to join this server to request an audit by the Construction Group of Corona Studios (Corona Industries). This is essentially a vanilla creative mode building server that showcases your Minecraft building skills in our rigorous environment. When we have a need to recruit new people, we will issue an invitation for further review based on the quality of the building works that have been submitted for review: after passing, you will join our architectural team. Perhaps you can not only develop your own abilities here, but also discover colleagues here? *This server is WIP!*

* CMFS-Juego There are various mainstream mini-games and arenas we have prepared, as well as unique mini-games conceived by us. It distinguishes multiple different game versions, providing experiences from different eras. *There is currently no person in charge of this server*

* CMFS-Login "Extended in all directions." This server is the entrance to the entire CMFS and is the transit server responsible for distributing players to the server they want to reach. You need to log in to the group server here through a CMFS account or a corona service account bound to a CMFS account. *This server needs to be rebuilt together with CMFS-Pure*
