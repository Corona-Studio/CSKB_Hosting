# How to use dashboard search

You can enter anything you want to find in the aggregate search box. After you entered something, smart prompts will pop up below to help you quickly navigate to the search results page.

## Use the specified search engine to find content

By default, LauncherX uses Bing to find your search.
If you want to specify the search engine used for aggregated searches, you can add the following prefix before your search content:

| Search Engine |  Key  |
|:----:|:---:|
|  Google  | g:  |
|  Bing  | b:  |
|  Baidu  | bd: |

### Examples

* Use Google to search "1.16.5 Texture Pack"：g:1.16.5 Texture Pack
* Use Bing to search "1.16.5 Texture Pack"：b:1.16.5 Texture Pack
* Use Baidu to search "1.16.5 Texture Pack"：bd:1.16.5 Texture Pack
