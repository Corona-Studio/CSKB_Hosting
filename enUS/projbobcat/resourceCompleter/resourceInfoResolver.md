# Resource information resolver

In ProjBobcat, we use **ResourceInfoResolver** (ResourceInfoResolver)
to help the resource completer identify missing files in MineCraft.

The following table shows the resource resolvers currently supported by ProjBobcat:

| Class name | Introduction |

| LibraryInfoResolver | Used to parse library files necessary for game startup |
| VersionInfoResolver | Used to parse JAR files provided in game JSON |
