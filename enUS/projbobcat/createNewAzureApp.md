## Start configuration

Before you get started, you first need a Microsoft account. There is no cost to register an Azure Active Directory app.

Sign in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) using your Microsoft account
After logging in, the page you see should look like this:

Click **New Registration** on the top toolbar and fill in the name of the application. And select **Microsoft Personal Account Only** in **Supported Account Types**.
Since we are not using URI callback based authentication. Therefore, you do not need to fill in the **Redirect URI** below the form.

::: warning
Please check the information in the form carefully, otherwise unexpected problems may occur in subsequent steps.

Then find the **Advanced Settings** section on the right and make sure that **Advanced SDK Support** and **Allow Public Client Flow** in the section are turned on.
If they are not turned on, turn them on manually.

On the right you will see the details of your application, find the **Application (Client) ID** in **Summary**,
This ID will be the Client ID you need to use during the [Microsoft Authenticator Configuration](/enUS/projbobcat/installationAndConfig) phase.
